There is a packaged build for Windows in Packaged/Windows

An action FPS game, where player with rifle, torch and access to cameras has to go through the room full of zombie.
It's a cooperative multiplayer game, so players can create sessions and join them.
It's pretty simple, key features are:
 - multiplayer,
 - shooting,
 - cameras system.

It was more a project to learn how multiplayer works and work a bit with sounds and animations.
